            <a href="http://johnrooksby.org/papers/CHI2016_Rooksby_Screenlife.pdf">Personal Tracking of Screen Time on Digital Devices. </a>
            <br>Rooksby J, Asadzadeh P, Rost M, Morrison A, and Chalmers M.
            <br>Accepted for CHI2016
            <br>
            <br>  Numerous studies have tracked people’s everyday use of
                  digital devices, but without consideration of how such data
                  might be of personal interest to the user. We have
                  developed a personal tracking application that enables users
                  to automatically monitor their ‘screen time’ on mobile
                  devices (iOS and Android) and computers (Mac and
                  Windows). The application interface enables users to
                  combine screen time data from multiple devices. We
                  trialled the application for 28+ days with 21 users,
                  collecting log data and interviewing each user. We found
                  that there is interest in personal tracking in this area, but
                  that the study participants were less interested in
                  quantifying their overall screen time than in gaining data
                  about their use of specific devices and applications. We
                  found that personal tracking of device use is desirable for
                  goals including: increasing productivity, disciplining device
                  use, and cutting down on use.

            <br>We present a novel class of mixed membership models for combining information from multiple data sources inferring inter-view and intra-view statistical associations. An important contemporary application of this work is the meaningful synthesis of data sources corresponding to smartphone application usage, app developers’ descriptions and customer feedback. We demonstrate the ability of the model to infer meaningful, interpretable and informative app usage patterns based on the app usage data augmented with rich text data describing the apps. We provide quantitative model evaluations showing the model provides significantly better predictive ability than comparative related existing methods.

            <br>Oana Andrei, Muffy Calder, Matthew Chalmers, Alistair Morrison, Mattias Rost.
            <br>Under review.
            <br>
            <br>This paper sets out a process of app analysis intended to support understanding of use but also redesign. From usage logs we infer activity patterns - Markov models - and employ probabilistic formal analysis to ask questions about the use of the app. The core of this paper's contribution is a bridging of stochastic and formal modelling, but we also describe the work to make that analytic core utile within a design team. We illustrate our work via a case study of a mobile app presenting analytic findings and discussing how they are feeding into redesign. We had posited that two activity patterns indicated two separable sets of users, each of which might benefit from a differently tailored app version, but our subsequent analysis detailed users' interleaving of activity patterns over time - evidence speaking more in favour of redesign that supports each pattern in an integrated way. We uncover patterns consisting of brief glances at particular data and recommend them as possible candidates for new design work on widget extensions: small displays available while users use other apps.

          <br>ICML'15 Lille, France.
          <br>
          <br>We present a novel class of mixed membership
              models for joint distributions of groups of observations
              that co-occur with ordinal response variables
              for each group for learning statistical associations
              between the ordinal response variables
              and the observation groups. The class of proposed
              models addresses a requirement for predictive
              and diagnostic methods in a wide range
              of practical contemporary applications. In this
              work, by way of illustration, we apply the models
              to a collection of consumer-generated reviews of
              mobile software applications, where each review
              contains unstructured text data accompanied with
              an ordinal rating, and demonstrate that the models
              infer useful and meaningful recurring patterns
              of consumer feedback. We also compare the developed
              models to relevant existing works, which
              rely on improper statistical assumptions for ordinal
              variables, showing significant improvements
              both in predictive ability and knowledge extraction.

          <br>
          <br> Analysis of trace logging data collections of interactions of a heterogenous and diverse population of consumers of digital software with mobile devices provides unprecedented possibilities for understanding how software is actually used and for finding recurring patterns of software usage over the population that are exhibited to greater or lesser degree in each individual software user. In this work, we consider an elementary mobile game played by a population of mobile gamers and collect pieces of game sessions over an extended period of time resulting in a collection of users’ trace logs for multiple sessions. We develop a simple, yet flexible, nonparametric Bayes approach to infer playing strategies adopted in the population from the logged traces of game interactions. We demonstrate our approach finds interpretable strategies and provides good predictive performance compared to alternative modelling assumptions using a nonparametric Bayes framework.

          <br>Abstract. We have conducted a video study of households in Scotland with cohabiting
                students and young professionals. In this paper we unpack five examples of how mobile
                devices are used by people watching television. In the examples we explore how screens
                are used together a) in a physical ecology, b) in an embodied way, c) in an orderly way,
                and d) with respect to others. We point out that mobile devices are routinely used to
                access media that is unconnected and unrelated to media on television, for example for
                sending and receiving messages, browsing social media, and browsing websites. We
                suggest that mobile devices are not used to directly enhance television programmes, but
                to enhance leisure time. We suggest that it is important, when considering mobile devices
                as second screens, not just to treat these as a design topic, but to pay attention to how
                they are interactionally integrated into the living room.

          <br>
          <br>In this paper we discuss an app we have implemented
              for iOS and Android called FITtogether. The app counts
              users’ steps and enables them to compare these with
              the average steps of all other users. We have trialed
              the app over a two week period in the wild on users’
              own devices. Our findings suggest that comparison with
              an average leads to users feeling that they are
              successful if they are above average, and that by
              making a personal step count available to others only
              as part of an average does not lead to anonymity and
              identity concerns.

          <br>
          <br>We have developed a mobile application called Pass The
              Ball that enables users to track, reflect on, and discuss
              physical activity with others. We followed an iterative
              design process, trialling a first version of the app with 20
              people and a second version with 31. The trials were
              conducted in the wild, on users’ own devices. The second
              version of the app enforced a turn-taking system that meant
              only one member of a group of users could track their
              activity at any one time. This constrained tracking at the
              individual level, but more successfully led users to
              communicate and interact with each other. We discuss the
              second trial with reference to two concepts: socialrelatedness
              and individual-competence. We discuss six key
              lessons from the trial, and identify two high-level design
              implications: attend to “practices” of tracking; and look
              within and beyond “collaboration” and “competition” in the
              design of activity trackers.

          <br>
          <br>This paper addresses the collection of data from consumer
              mHealth applications (mobile health apps). We use two consumer
              mHealth apps as examples, both of which we have developed and
              released. The apps are both designed to encourage and support
              walking: the first by way of a Commonwealth Games theme; and
              the second by way of a football themed competition. We discuss
              what data we collected from these apps, broadly categorizing it in
              terms of user statistics, game-relevant data, usage data and
              processed data. We also outline the ethical issues in collecting
              such data. We give two reasons for collecting data: to understand
              activity and to inform design. We then argue that a grand
              challenge in public health is to collect data across various apps in
              order to understand and support the mHealth “ecosystem”, i.e. the
              mass of apps that people have access to and can choose between.

          <br>
          <br>  In using 'app store'-style software repositories to distribute research applications, substantial ethical challenge exists in gaining informed consent from potential participants. Standard 'terms and conditions' pages are commonly used, but we find they fail to communicate relevant information to users. We suggest interrupting use of an application with a visual representation of collected data, rather than merely providing a description at first launch. Data collected, but not uploaded, before this can be used to create personalised examples of what will be shared. We experiment with different ways of presenting this information and allowing opt-out mechanisms, finding that users are more concerned when presented with a visual, personalised representation, and consequently stop using the application sooner. We observe a particular difference in non-English speakers, suggesting that our proposed approach might be especially appropriate for global trials, where not all users will be able to understand researchers' disclosures of data logging intent.

          <br> Software developers cannot always anticipate how users will
                actually use their software as it may vary from user to user, and even
                from use to use for an individual user. In order to address questions raised
                by system developers and evaluators about software usage, we define new
                probabilistic models that characterise user behaviour, based on activity
                patterns inferred from actual logged user traces. We encode these new
                models in a probabilistic model checker and use probabilistic temporal
                logics to gain insight into software usage. We motivate and illustrate our
                approach by application to the logged user traces of an iOS app.

          <br>The coding dojo is a technique for continuous learning and training.
              Randori is one implementation format. Even though experience and lessons
              learnt on how coding dojos could be better organized have been reported in
              agile literature, the theoretical bases behind it have never been investigated. In
              this paper we propose to use reflective practice as a sense-making device to
              underpin the investigation and improvement of coding dojo for effective
              learning. Based on the examination of two dojo sessions we argue that the
              insights from the reflective practice and related theories can open new and
              interesting inquiries on coding dojo, and eventually help to better understand
              the dynamics of coding dojo, and improve the dojo practice accordingly.

          <br>
          <br>This paper discusses a repetition of a study presented in
              Suchman’s book Plans and Situated Actions. There have
              been complaints about the lack of replication studies in
              disciplines related to CSCW (particularly Software
              Engineering and HCI). However, these complaints often
              become embedded in wider attempts to install a principled
              scientific method within these disciplines. Plans and
              Situated Actions was not a scientific text but drew upon
              naturalistic analysis. This paper shows there is value in
              recreating Plans and Situated Actions, and argues it would
              be helpful to recreate other studies. However, such
              repetition does not and need not constitute a scientific
              replication. The paper argues that while repetition and
              reanalysis may improve rigour in computing research, this
              need not be with a view to making it more scientific.

          <br>
          <br>This paper characterises the use of activity trackers as "lived informatics". This characterisation is contrasted with other discussions of personal informatics and the quantified self. The paper reports an interview study with activity tracker users. The study found: people do not logically organise, but interweave various activity trackers, sometimes with ostensibly the same functionality; that tracking is often social and collaborative rather than personal; that there are different styles of tracking, including goal driven tracking and documentary tracking; and that tracking information is often used and interpreted with reference to daily or short term goals and decision making. We suggest there will be difficulties in personal informatics if we ignore the way that personal tracking is enmeshed with everyday life and people's outlook on their future.

          <br>   Designing with Users for Domestic Environments. Workshop at CSCW 2014.
          <br>
          <br>   We have been studying how people use mobile phones and laptops while watching television. Our results show that these are not necessarily used to access content that is related to what is being watched. However, this is not to say devices are being used in isolation from their surrounds; their use is interwoven with watching television and with interacting with other people. We suggest that designing for ‘the connected home’ is more than an integration project, and should take account of the social fabric of domestic life.

          <br> This paper discusses our experiences in logging app use on computers, mobile phones and tablets. We have created logging software to record app launches on iOS, Android and Mac OS X devices, and have used this in a study with 13 students over a period of one month. This paper discusses the practicalities of logging across multiple devices, the forms of enquiry suitable for log analysis, and the ethics of logging. We also discuss future work in which we will scale the study up to thousands of users.
