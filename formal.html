    <h1>Formal Analysis</h1>


        <p>
          Some challenges raised by developing mobile applications come from the way these apps interweave with everyday life and are distributed globally via application centres or stores to a wide range of users. People use an app according to their needs and understanding such that, on one side, one could observe variations in usage frequencies of features or time and duration of use. On the other side, the same mobile app varies with app settings, phone settings, device model or even operating system. Software usage scenarios and variability are mostly covered at the design stage, but this may not always be the case for mobile applications. One aim of our current research is to help app developers create more predictable and usable context-dependent, module-based software systems. Our approach is iterative and incremental app development. We plan to model and analyse user activity patterns and software configurations in use as inferred by the Inference Methods project from qualitative and quantitative logged user data.
        </p>
        <p>
          We work towards a formal modelling approach suitable for representing the user activity patterns and the structural variability of a software system, based on a stochastic abstraction of the populations of software in use and the software uses. The first stage of the project is to define a bespoke formal model for user behaviour with respect to the populations of users they belong to. The second stage consists in identifying or defining a formal model for populations of configurations, for capturing variability, configurability and the component-based structure or modularity of a software system. We will compose the two orthogonal concerns, populations of user activity patterns and populations of software structure varieties, to obtain richer probabilistic population models. At each step we will also consider which analysis techniques of the models based on probabilistic model checking are relevant and useful for developers and evaluators, and to what extent the processes can be automated.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the first stage we will use Probabilistic Model Checking to analyse temporal relationships between events and their occurrence likelihood in the population models of user behaviour. For example, we can provide developers with metrics about app interface usability and temporal relationships between user
        </p>
        <p>
          activity patterns that are more desirable than others in terms of functional and non-functional requirements of the app. We can also observe how a population of users changes behaviour longitudinally, e.g. did users in 2010 behave significantly differently from users in 2012? As a consequence, developers might rethink the app design to make frequent or desirable behaviours easier to carry out and undesirable or infrequent ones more difficult. Probabilistic model checking with transition rewards/costs can also help evaluators and developers understand the impact of future design changes on quantitative usability metrics before actually changing the app, e.g., would the intended design changes decrease or increase the expected battery usage or the expected score value in the game app?
        </p>
        <p>
          This project builds upon inputs from Tools and Infrastructure (T and I), Inference Methods (IM) and Experiences: system functional and performance requirements, the logged user and application data in the repository, IMâ€™s inferences made about that data, and the applications developed in Experiences. The outputs are primarily to T and I: real-time, critical feedback to users, longer-term feedback to evaluators and developers, and an indication of which algorithms and analyses can be carried out in real-time. Currently we are creating models of the Hungry Yoshi and App Tracker applications. Discussions with the researchers in those projects about the needs and characteristics of the various apps are guiding us in the definition of the choice of a formal model. In turn, we provide these projects with insights on the capabilities of different formal models, the aspects of an app that are interesting from a modelling research point of view, what kind of data we expect, and formal analysis and requirements with respect to a future tool integration.
