	<strong>WHAT WILL TAKING PART IN THE RESEARCH MEAN FOR ME?</strong>
	
	<p>If you agree to take part in the study, data from the app will be collected continuously, so that we can tell how you are using the app, and identify any changes in your levels of physical activity. You can use the app as much or as little as you wish.</p>

	<strong>WILL I BENEFIT FROM TAKING PART?</strong>
