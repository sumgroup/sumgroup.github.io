    <h1>Tools and Infrastructure</h1>

    The Tools and Infrastructure project is currently focusing on logging technology and modular software.

    <h2>Logging</h2>

    <p>
      Prior to designing and developing adaptive and flexible systems for varying populations of users, it is vital that populations can be identified and understood. Today, software applications are used on a myriad of devices, and mobile systems play an increasing part of users’ digital lives. However, tracking activity on mobile devices remains difficult, and there are few applications or APIs to support detailed and persistent logging. Furthermore, the tools that do exist are relatively simple, and are unable to adapt to the many contexts each mobile device (and its user) may encounter throughout the day.
    </p>

    <p>
      As part of the project we are working to create logging and tracking systems for both desktop and mobile systems. By tracking the same user as they move from one device to another we hope to gain a fuller picture than logging systems that focus on just one type of hardware. Essentially, we aim to identify, track and analyse a user’s digital day.
    </p>

    <p>
      To date, we have created a unique tracking infrastructure that runs across desktop/laptop, tablet and smartphone devices. Objective-C has been our lead development platform, and so our system provides support for OS X and iOS devices. However, we plan to increase support for further devices, and work on Android tracking has progressed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our extensive past experience of trialling both desktop and mobile systems—and our more recent experience within Populations—has identified a pressing need for any logging or tracking system to be extremely flexible. Our tracking infrastructure is designed to be extremely flexible and adaptive; responding to changes in user and device context. For example, whilst most logging systems provide a static, preset rate of logging, ours is able to ramp up logging rates, and add new types of logging, during key periods or when requested remotely.
    </p>

    <p>
      Currently, we are setting up a trial of our logging and tracking infrastructure in which we will monitor user activity as one moves from one device to another; building a record of the user’s digital day. A set
      of App Tracker applications, one running on each device, will allow us to better understand when and why users move between laptops, tablets and phones, and what tasks they perform wholly or partly on each.
    </p>

    <h2>Modular</h2>

    <p>
      Modular software is crucial to supporting large and varying populations of users, as it allows flexibility, both in updating/replacing components, and in providing different software and workflow configurations to differing groups.
    </p>
    <p>
      Designing and implementing a modular software infrastructure is a challenging task, particularly on mobile devices, and one that should not be undertaken in a way blind to the particular requirements of the Populations project.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to better understand these requirements such a modular infrastructure may be expected to fulfil, we have been creating and experimenting with real software deployments. Theory and practice in this area are wide-ranging but not straightforwardly consistent or prescriptive—mapping out these matters this is itself a topic of future work—and so we believe that by releasing and testing with actual large-scale software deployments we will be able to identify and address relevant issues more rapidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have, thus far, created and released one piece of software, PostFactory, that utilises a modular infrastructure for iOS that we have designed and implemented, and are currently nearing completion of a second, Match FFIT. Our modular infrastructure provides a framework in which a developer can quickly create a software module that can be inserted into an existing user’s workflow. Modules in our framework know how to instantiate themselves, declare input requirements, and supply information about the outputs they provide. Modules also declare the types of data they accept and output, and this allows the user to configure module combinations that perform various operations on different types of data (text, audio,
      images), or for the system to propose combinations of modules that work together. Our framework also includes a data bundle class that encapsulates a tuple-space that can be passed between modules. A formalised representation of such a bundle is important to allow data to flow between module combinations and for modules to perform operations on the data within. Modules are able to inspect data bundles and only operate on the data if appropriate, and gracefully handle operations on bundles where expected data may not be found, or other errors occur.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mobile platform presents many implementation and distribution issues, as utilising truly dynamic code can be problematic due to restrictions both in mobile operating systems and those introduced by popular mobile distribution platforms, such as the Apple App Store, Android Market, or Windows Phone Store. For this reason, although we have implemented a system for loading and installing code modules dynamically at runtime, we currently design our systems to work through the introduction of additional or replacement software modules during app updates, when we take the opportunity to load a large static library of potential modules, rather than doing this in an ad hoc, piece-by-piece manner.
